Gnarls Barkley - Crazy Adaptation
===

A vocal performance by [Catt McCreary](http://www.cattmccreary.com/) with accompaniment by me and Griffin Baumberger. This was really our first shot at music production and mastering in Logic, so the product isn't quite as polished as it could be with a bit more experience.
The video filmed on a Lumix GH4 with a Nikkor 12-24mm f4 and Metabones Speedbooster. The car is Cole's 1974 Formula 400 Firebird driven around various parts of Atlanta.
