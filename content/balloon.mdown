High Altitude Balloon Video
===

Video made to commemmorate the launch of the **Makers Club's** High Altitude Balloon. It took off 20 miles northeast of Atlanta and landed east of Charlotte, North Carolina (~300 miles away). The flight lasted around five hours with the balloon reaching apogee at around **85,000 feet**. Shot in collaboration with [Cole Johnson](http://colejoh.com/) on a Canon 60D and Rebel T3i. Footage from onboard the balloon was done with a GoPro. Final cut by Cole. *The video is likely to be flagged for copyright as the soundtrack is from Hans Zimmer's score of Inception.*
