Geronimo
===

The first real short I've ever been able to make, produced over the past two months with a great group of people. Filmed on the GH4 with a speedbooster and **Nikon 12-24** lens. Certain angles employed a telephoto. Shots from outside the car were mounted onto a steel plate screwed onto two [industrial suction cups](http://www.homedepot.com/p/QEP-4-7-8-in-Suction-Cup-for-Handling-Large-Tile-and-Glass-75000Q/100119050).  
All of the audio production was done inside Premiere from folley and dialogue recorded by an **NTG-3** into the **DR60D**'s preamps.
