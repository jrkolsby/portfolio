Gatsby Prom Introduction
===

I made this video with [Cole Johnson](http://colejoh.com/) to introduce the theme of my high school's prom. It was filmed using both a Canon 60D and T3i, edited in Final Cut 7, and colored in **Apple Color**. A lot of the footage turned out underexposed for which Color was unable to compensate. The scene is very noisy at some points.
