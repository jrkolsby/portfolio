High Altitude Balloon Video
===

Video made as the Lovett Makers Club's entry into the Global Space Balloon Challenge. The last launch took off 20 miles northeast of Atlanta and landed east of Charlotte, North Carolina (~300 miles away). The flight lasted around five hours with the balloon reaching apogee at around **85,000 feet**. This balloon flew less far, landing on a roof around Kennesaw, Georgia. It was picked up by the local fire department who graciously saved it from a police investigation
